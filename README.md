- **dbt Cloud** – ELT modeling with tests, incremental logic, and documentation  
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** – Orchestration of EL pipelines  
- **GitHub** – CI/CD versioning and deployment  
- **SQL, Jinja, dbt tests, Source freshness**

## 🧩 **Key Features**

- 📌 **Tracks missing/unverified documents** after mortgage loan sanction  
- 🔄 Maintains **stage-wise document flow** (KYC → Legal → Technical → Disbursal)  
- ✅ **dbt tests** ensure data quality (`not_null`, `unique`, `relationships`)  
- 🧪 **Mart models** are clean, tested, and **UAT-ready**  
- 📊 Feeds into dashboard layer for **audit, compliance, and executive review**
